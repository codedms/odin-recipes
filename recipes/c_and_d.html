    <h1>Chicken and Dumplings</h1>
        <p>Chicken and dumplings is a comforting and hearty dish that combines tender, flavorful chicken with fluffy dumplings simmered in a savory broth. The chicken is typically cooked until it becomes tender and falls off the bone, infusing the broth with rich flavors. The dumplings, made from a simple mixture of flour, baking powder, milk, and butter, are dropped into the bubbling broth and cook to perfection, soaking up the delicious flavors. The result is a warm and satisfying meal with a combination of tender chicken, soft dumplings, and a comforting broth that warms the soul. Chicken and dumplings is a classic comfort food enjoyed by many for its simplicity, heartiness, and nourishing qualities.</p>
    <u><h2>Ingredients:</h2></u>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces (or 4-6 bone-in chicken thighs)</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>For the dumplings:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cups milk</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    <h2><u>Directions:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the chicken pieces, chicken broth, water, chopped onion, sliced carrots, sliced celery, minced garlic, bay leaf, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, prepare the dumplings. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the milk and melted butter, and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and set it aside to cool slightly. Discard the bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the broth mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>While the broth is boiling, shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding the skin and bones.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of the dumpling batter into the boiling broth, creating small dumplings. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the dumplings simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked through and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Once the dumplings are cooked, return the shredded chicken to the pot. Stir gently to combine and heat everything through.</li>
        <li>Taste the chicken and dumplings and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken and dumplings hot in bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your chicken and dumplings!</p>
