    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <u><h2>Ingredients:</h2></u>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzerella cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional, garnish)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2><u>Directions:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set them aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the onion is softened.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine all the ingredients. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to assemble the lasagna. Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread about one-third of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat these layers two more times, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it's tightly sealed to prevent any moisture from escaping. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese on top is melted and slightly golden.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired. Cut into pieces and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your lasagna!</p>
